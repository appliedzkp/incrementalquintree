# An incremental Merkle tree written in Typescript

This repository provides a Typescript implementation of an incremental Merkle
tree which supports either 2 (binary) or 5 (quinary) leaves per node.

The original code is from the [MACI
project](https://github.com/appliedzkp/maci), but has been placed in its own
repository and NPM package so other projects can use it.

`circom` circuits for zero-knowledge applications are also included.

Solidity contracts are not included (yet).
